# Object Detection and Distance Estimation Application

This Python application uses computer vision techniques to perform object detection and estimate distances using YOLOv8, the COCO dataset, the cvzone library, and tkinter for the GUI.

## Features

- Object detection using YOLOv8 and the COCO dataset
- Distance estimation between detected objects and the camera
- User-friendly GUI built with tkinter
- Easy-to-use interface for webcam with guidelines

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- cvzone
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 weights and configuration files (download from the official YOLO website)
- COCO dataset

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akankshmakam/object-detection-and-distance-estimation-application.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the YOLOv8 weights and configuration files from the official YOLO website.

4. Download the COCO dataset.

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Select an image or video file for object detection and distance estimation.

3. View the detected objects and estimated distances in the GUI.
